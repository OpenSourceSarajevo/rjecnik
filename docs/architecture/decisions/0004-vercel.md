# 4. Vercel

Date: 2025-??-??

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We needed a reliable, cost-effective, and scalable hosting solution for the application.

## Decision

We chose Vercel as our hosting provider because:

- First-class support for Next.js: Vercel is the creator of Next.js and provides an optimized deployment experience.
- Global CDN & Edge Functions: Ensures fast loading times across different regions.
- Serverless API routes: Enables backend-like functionality without additional infrastructure.
- Built-in analytics: Provides insights via Vercel Analytics for tracking performance.

## Consequences

### Benefits

- Zero-config deployment: No need for manual infrastructure setup.
- Auto-scaling: Easily handles traffic spikes.
- Free tier available: Suitable for early-stage development.
- Tight integration with Next.js features (ISR, SSR, static exports).

### Drawbacks

- Vendor lock-in: Migration to another provider may require adjustments.
- Limited backend capabilities: While serverless functions exist, complex backend operations may require external APIs.
